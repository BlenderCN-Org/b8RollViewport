# RollViewport addon for Blender 2.8x
Roll the Blender 2.8x viewport with **ctrl-alt** and the **pen** or **mouse pointer**.

+ MMB rotate and confirm the rotation
+ LMB continuously rotate
+ RMB cancel  the rotation

Note: You can always quickly reset the view rotation with alt + MMB + drag.

This is very helpful for me when working in the Blender viewport. I just quickly hacked the 
available code for my purposes. 
It's obvious that more work is needed to make it more user-friendly.
