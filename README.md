# RollViewport addon for Blender 2.8x
Roll the Blender 2.8x viewport with **ctrl-alt** and the **pen** or the **mouse pointer**.

+ MMB: Rotate and confirm the rotation.
+ LMB: Continuously rotate.
+ RMB: Cancel  the rotation.

Note: You can always quickly reset the viewport rotation using alt + MMB + drag!

This is very helpful for me when working in the Blender viewport. I just quickly hacked the 
available code for my purposes. 
It's obvious that more work is needed to make it more user-friendly.

Great addition, I was looking desperately for something like this!

Closing as archived, over 3 years old, broken.

Please fix this addon ASAP!

Thanks so much!

"not useful" O_o
